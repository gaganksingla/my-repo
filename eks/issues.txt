##  AWS Env Issues and Learnings
###########
1. Storage Classes should be gp2 and should be created - This might cause issues with provisioning PV
2. If account level SCP has explicit deny for UnEncrypted EBS volumes then storage class should have "encrypted"=true. to allow PVC to create volume
3. AWS CSI driver node health should be good and service account role of kube-system should be same as the one that has permission to create EBS volume
4. If PV, PVC is stuck in terminating status - PVC should be deleted first and the PV. If PVC is stuck then edit that PVC yaml and remove finalizer then run below command.
kubectl delete pv pvc-cae3a766-41eb-4317-8de1-04e6b7291ea9 -n springboot-kafka --grace-period=0 --force

5. If any unauthorized access issue in kubectl get events or CloudTrail - run below to decode the Message
aws sts decode-authorization-message --encoded-message 'EncryptedError' 

6. If AWS ELB isnt getting created via kubectl service type LoadBalancer - Create a loadbalancer controller Service account and a POD along with Trust Policy for OIDC Provider AssumeWebIdentity for LoadBalancer Controller Service account

7. Unable to delete a SVC ELB
kubectl patch svc keycloak1 -n springboot-kafka -p '{"metadata":{"finalizers":null}}'

8. Delete unhealthy nodes.
kubectl drain --ignore-daemonsets <node name>

kubectl drain --ignore-daemonsets ip-192-168-87-117.ap-south-1.compute.internal

## Perf Test Learnings.
1. Limited control in Bitnami Helm for Kafka, can be overriden by --set parameter for helm or apply custom values
2. Prefer Strimzi Kafka which is a more matured version and has useful documentation and easy customization. 
3. Kafka has by default auto.create.topic.enable=true. This needs to be overrriden in Kafka Properties.
4. To scale consumers no of partitions for a topic should be >= to no of consumers needed



Other Considerations
1. Scaling mongodb
2. Adding configs for all Kafka brokers
3. Grafana Dashboard issues
4. Prepare Kafka Scaling and Prod Params
5. Fix Ingress Issues
6. HPA, Resource Quotas
7. Security, Perf and NodeAffinity
8. How to decide Horizontal vs Vertical Scaling. 
9. Architecture with Total size and size given to each POD
9. PPT - Scaling of each service, Observations and Bench marks
